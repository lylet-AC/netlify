      <description>Introduction BlockBuster is a game that was created for the Computer Science 480: Software Innovation course at Allegheny College. BlockBuster is a sort of Arkanoid clone game with a twist. The twist is that the user can insert their own images as playable levels. BlockBuster comes with pre-selected levels in the form of famous movie title cards. These title card images are then resized by BlockBuster and reconstructed into playable levels that the user breaks with a ball and paddle similar to that of famous classic games, such as: Arkanoid, Breakout, Block Breaker Deluxe, and the shareware title Super-DX Ball.</description>
